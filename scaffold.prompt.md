Below is an arduino code. Please remove all the comments first. Then, generate detailed comments for each statement with a lot of hints for students to fill in. Last, remove all the code statements in function bodies but keep all the comments and the function body signatures. Output the formatted final code only.

```cpp

```

Final example code for reference

```cpp
/*
Simple program that blinks an LED.
*/

// Declare a read-only integer constant named 'ledPin' and assign the appropriate pin number for the LED.
// Hint: Use the pinMode() function with ledPin and OUTPUT as its arguments.
const int ledPin = 13;

// Define the setup() function, which is executed only once during powerup.
void setup() {
  // Set the pinMode of the 'ledPin' as OUTPUT (digital output).
  // Hint: Use the pinMode() function with ledPin and OUTPUT as its arguments.

}

// Define the loop() function, which is called repeatedly during the program execution.
void loop() {
  // Turn the LED on by setting a HIGH voltage to the 'ledPin'.
  // Hint: Use the digitalWrite() function with ledPin and HIGH as its arguments.

  // Wait for 1000 milliseconds (1 second) before executing the next command.
  // Hint: Use the delay() function with 1000 as its argument.

}
